1) All queries are based on native logging from the remote origin (_unless indicated in the specific README_) and not custom scripts to export logs in potentially different formats. If you do choose to not adhere to this, your parsing structure and fields may produce unexpected results.
2) All queries are written and tested in Sumo Logic's cloud tenant environment and not specific to any versions of code or syntax.
3) Simply copy and paste the search query syntax provided and paste into your Sumo Logic instance, amend the relevant `source[]` or `collector` ingestion variable and enjoy!
